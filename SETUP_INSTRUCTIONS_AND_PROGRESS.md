# Intro

I'll be doing these kind of assessment more than once, so documenting the setup progress will be useful as reference and also to asses in detail **how** I work.

The instructions are broad: "The purpose of this test assignment is to assess the applicant's automation skills, allowing him/her to show the best they can do and how fast they can learn."

My main tasks will be:
 * Get development environment up and running
 * Get the supplied app working 
 * Run the supplied default test
   * ``ExampleInstrumentedTest.kt``
   * ``ExampleUnitTest.kt``
 * Exploratory testing on the supplied application
 * Think up some test scripts

# Setup

I use a sandbox environment for my professional projects to minimize external influences. 

## System
 * Ubuntu 24 (XFCE window manager)
 * Android Studio "Koala"

   ```sudo apt install openjdk-18-jdk```

   ```sudo snap install android-studio --classic```
